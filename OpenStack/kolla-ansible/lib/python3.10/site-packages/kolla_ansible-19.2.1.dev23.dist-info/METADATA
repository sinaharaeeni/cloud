The Kolla Ansible is a deliverable project separated from Kolla project.

Kolla Ansible deploys OpenStack services and infrastructure components
in Docker containers.

Kolla's mission statement is:

::

    To provide production-ready containers and deployment tools for operating
    OpenStack clouds.

Kolla is highly opinionated out of the box, but allows for complete
customization. This permits operators with little experience to deploy
OpenStack quickly and as experience grows modify the OpenStack
configuration to suit the operator's exact requirements.

Getting Started
===============

Learn about Kolla Ansible by reading the documentation online
`Kolla Ansible <https://docs.openstack.org/kolla-ansible/latest/>`__.
